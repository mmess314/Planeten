# Planeten
This program calculates and displays planetary orbits.
Orbit calculation is performed using initial positions and velocities of a number of bodies which are numerically integrated using Newton's laws applied to small time intervalls.
Displaying is done on a Canvas showing the actual and past positions of the bodies.
